/*
When doing these tasks, we recommend using console.log to test the output of your code to make sure it works correctly.
This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

Use the hungryDog function and feeding requirements below to do the following:
1. Invoke the hungryDog function below and pass it a weight value in pounds
2. Also, pass to hungryDog an age value in years (note: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal. For example: three months = 3/12 or .25)
3. Do the proper calculations and return the number of pounds of raw food to feed the dog/puppy in a day

REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights

Feeding Requirements:

Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
   up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
   6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
   11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight 
   > 15lbs - 2% of their body weight 

Puppies less than 1 year
   2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
   4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
   7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
  
NOTE: If done correctly, a weight of 15 lbs and age of 1 year would return 0.44999999999999996

// Rock, Paper, Scissors - Let's play against the computer!

Create a global variable that randomly generates the computer's choice
Use Math.random to determine the computers choice (Math.random gives a random number between 0 and 1)

NOTE: Computer must be a global variable. It will be passed into the function as an argument when the function is invoked. 

HINT: While you can complete this with only conditionals based on strings, it may help to equate choice to a number when using Math.random()

Use the game function below to do the following:
1. Receive 2 parameters the user's choice and the computer's choice
2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below - the strings returned need to match the strings below exactly.
 - win should return "you win!"
 - lose should return "you lose!"
 - tie should return "it's a tie"

RULES OF THE GAME: Scissors beats Paper | Paper beats Rock | Rock beats Scissors | Or there's a tie

HINT: Remember that the order in which we pass in our arguments matters when it comes to parameters
